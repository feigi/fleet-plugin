// Regression gate for inflight.sh, the probe that decides whether a ticket is
// already being worked on:
// `./agent-test skills/fleet/scripts/inflight.test.mjs`.
//
// The load-bearing cases are the `linked:` rows. `linked` comes from
// `gh issue view --json closedByPullRequestsReferences`, which projects only
// `{id, number, repository, url}` — measured. (The underlying GraphQL nodes are
// PullRequest and do carry `state`; reaching it costs a third round-trip, so the
// script reads state off the `gh pr list` window it already fetches.) A state
// the window cannot supply has to stay a hit rather than silently free a ticket.
//
// `gh` is stubbed on PATH; `git`, `python3` and `jq` are real. The stub pipes
// canned JSON through the real `jq` so the script's own `--jq` expression is
// under test rather than hard-coded into the fixture. Note that this makes the
// suite need one binary the script does not: `gh --jq` is an embedded engine, so
// inflight.sh shells out to no `jq` at all, and a host without it fails this
// suite while the script itself works fine.
