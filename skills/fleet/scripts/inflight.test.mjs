// its state can only come from the `gh pr list` window the script already
// fetches, and a state the window cannot supply has to stay a hit rather than
// silently freeing a ticket.
//
// `gh` is stubbed on PATH; `git`, `python3` and `jq` are real. The stub pipes
// canned JSON through the real `jq` so the script's own `--jq` expression is
// under test rather than hard-coded into the fixture.
